This repository was created to share and merge existing LaTex related files.

##### csem.bib ###########

In particular it would be valuable to have an ever growing and up-to-date
BibTex file shared by the CSEM group. It should be fairly easy to add 
new entries to csem.bib (simply follow the pattern, and keep the alphabetic
ordering).

It is also quite easy to merge in a whole BibTex file. 
As long as the file is in the same format, the procedure is roughly:

1. emacs NEW.bib                              # get rid of stuff before the 
                                              # first @item in the new bib file
                                              # Correct errors/format etc.
2. sort_bib.pl csem.bib NEW.bib > csemnew.bib
3. tkdiff csem.bib csemnew.bib                # Check if the merge worked. 
                                              # If not go back to step 1.
4. mv csemnew.bib csem.bib                    # Replace old bib file
5. cvs commit csem.bib                        # Commit merged bib file

Step 3 is very essential to make sure that the merge was successful. 
The assumption is that if there is any overlap between the original csem.bib
and NEW.bib then the NEW.bib file has the better/more up-to-date information. 
If this is not the case, remove the overlapping items from NEW.bib

##### TIGcommands.sty ###########

Many useful definitions for formulas, like bold face for vectors (e.g. \bB)

##### latexdiff ###########

Create a difference between two latex files. Very useful for 
manuscript revisions.

##### l2hconf.pm ###########

A modified version of the Perl module used by latex2html which produces
high resolution fonts. Useful to create GIF files that can be pasted into
talks and posters. However, the LatexIt utility is a much better alternative.
